# Simply Meals
- The Simply Meals app can plan out random meals for you! It will present you the cost per portion, the ingredients, and the recipe of random meals.
- Users are able to enter a desired price range as well as the number of meals that they want to generate and the app will automatically show random dishes that fit the needs of the user.
- Keep in mind, if the price per meal is too low, the app may not show any meals. Also, the app may not show the desired number of meals if there are not enough meals under the price the user requested.  
- Simply Meals uses an API (the API is spoonacular) to get all the random meals, along with the meals price, ingredients, and recipe.
- When the meal has been generated, an image representing the meal will show along with the ingredients and the recipe for that meal so the user can choose which dish they want to make. The user can then click on the "Show Ingredients" and "Show Recipe" buttons to see the ingredients needed to prepare the meals as well as the steps that need to be taken to make them.
